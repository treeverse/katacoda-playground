## Welcome to the lakeFS Playground!

In this tutorial we’ll work with a sample dataset to give you a sense for the ways lakeFS makes it easy to work with data.

We will learn how to use lakeFS using lakectl, and how to run basic commands - manage and explore repositories, commits and files.

As part of this exercise you will also create a new branch, run a Spark job, check out the diff and merge it.



For more information about lakeFS or lakectl go to the [lakeFS docs](https://docs.lakefs.io)

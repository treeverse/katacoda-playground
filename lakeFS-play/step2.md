# Reading and writing lakeFS objects.

Once we have a repository 

we could add an object to lakeFS by using the fs command

### Add an object from an existing source.
The following command will add the object title.episode.tsv.gz to lakeFS under the path /imdb/title.episode.tsv.gz in branch master. 
`lakectl fs upload lakefs://my-repo@master/imdb/title.episode.tsv.gz --source title.episode.tsv.gz`{{execute}}

### Add an object using stdin,
The following command will add the object object.txt under path /sample in branch master
`echo "this is a sample" | lakectl fs upload lakefs://my-repo@master/sample/object.txt --source -`{{execute}}

We could now use the ls command to list the objects in our repository
`lakectl fs ls lakefs://my-repo@master/`{{execute}}
 
We got the paths under root, imdb and sample
If we would like to see the objects and paths under sample:
`lakectl fs ls lakefs://my-repo@master/sample/`{{execute}} 
 
To view the objects metadata we could use the stat command:
`lakectl fs stat lakefs://my-repo@master/sample/object.txt`{{execute}}

To dump the content of a object use the cat command:
`lakectl fs cat lakefs://my-repo@master/sample/object.txt`{{execute}}

Remove the object with the rm command
`lakectl fs rm lakefs://my-repo@master/sample/object.txt`{{execute}}
